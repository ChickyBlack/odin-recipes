    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pillsbury Pie Crusts, softened as directed on box</li>
        <li>1.5 cups firmly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup very soft butter (not melted)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350°F. Spray 18 regular-size muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>On work surface, unroll pie crusts. With 3 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut 9 
            rounds from each crust, rerolling dough as necessary. Gently press 1 dough round 
            into each muffin cup.
        </li>
        <li>In medium bowl, beat remaining ingredients with spoon until well blended (mixture 
            will be slightly lumpy). Spoon about 2 tablespoons brown sugar mixture into each tart.
        </li>
        <li>Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until filling is set and crust is golden brown. Run knife 
            around edge of each tart. Cool in pan, about 30 minutes. Remove tarts to serving plate. 
            Serve warm or cooled. Store covered in refrigerator.
